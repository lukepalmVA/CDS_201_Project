## Version Information
This is Version 1.0 of NetDistrict.

## What Is NetDistrict?
Netdistrict is a Netlogo model that takes a small world of voter blocks, puts them in to districts, and then randomly fusses with those districts according to some basic scoring functions. Right now, it's mostly a toy to play with, but a lot of grunt work is out of the way if you want to try to do serious analysis with this sort of model. 

## Why Netlogo?

Agent-based modeling offers some interesting design patterns, since both the links and the blocks (ie census blocks, VTDs, wards - whatever your unit of districting is) are modeled as agentsets. While our intuition says that the voters should be agents, by modeling blocks as agents, we can take the criteria of map building and express those criteria as agential preferences. This lets us think about redistricting locally, on the margins of the potential change, in combination with map-wide metrics. Will this be useful? Who knows, but now you've got the tools to find out.

### Wait, so this whole model might be totally pointless?
You get what you paid for, buddy.

## How does it work right now?

### Setup

On setup, Netdistrict starts by creating a 15x15 square of voter blocks. Currently, this is a hard-coded requirement. It would be easy to spawn blocks in other shapes, but having the districts and visualizations work in arbitrary conditions would be really tricky. I left  more detail in the comments of the code, especially color-districts. 

 These blocks are assigned a partisan-score of 0 (colored red) or 1 (colored blue). Then, the following clumping algorithm is ran:

> Take your partisan score, plus the sum of your neighbors. (Note that here and throughout, "neighbor" means the blocks that are linked to you. Currently, these are your orthogonal neighbors.) Average the scores by dividing by the count of you plus your neighbors. If the average is on one side of .5 and your score is on the other, change to the other value. Repeat until no blocks flip when running this algorithm.

After the partisan values are calculated, they are moderated to be more continuous. Each block starts with intrinsic-moderation (set by a slider in the Interface tab) and adds .1 for each opposite neighbor. For blocks with partisan-score 0, a random floating point number between 0 and this value is added to their partisan-score. For blocks with partisan-score 1, this value is instead subtracted from their partisan-score.

Then, the patches (and consequently, the blocks) are assigned nine starting districts by taking the nine 5x5 subgraphs that collectively span the space.

An election is held upon setup, as well as every tick.

### Election Rules

One district at a time, each block's partisan-score is evaluated.

>If a partisan-score is below .5 by a margin greater than uncertainty-threshold, it's called a red vote. If a partisan-score is below .5, but by a margin less than uncertainty-threshold (set by a slider in the Interface tab), it's called a lean-red vote. Similarly, partisan-scores more than uncertainty-threshold above .5 are blue votes, whereas votes less than uncertainty-threshold above .5 are lean-blue votes.

Once we've tallied all the votes for a given district, we can figure out the overall result for that district.

>If the red votes outnumber the blue, lean-blue, and lean-red votes, it's a red district.
If that's not true, but the red votes plus the lean-red votes outnumber the blue-votes plus lean-blue votes, it's a lean-red district. 
If the blue votes outnumber the red, lean-red, and lean-blue votes, it's a blue district.
If that's not true, but the blue votes plus the lean-blue votes outnumber the red-votes plus lean-red votes, it's a lean-blue district.
If none of those four outcomes happen, it's a "split district". 

The value of the last tallying of a district is stored in each patch of that district, to make it easier to validate.

Once each district's value is determined, we can figure out the overall election result.

>If red districts outnumber all other districts combined, the election is a red win.
If red districts plus lean-red districts outnumber all other districts combined, the election is a red likely win.
If blue districts outnumber all other districts combined, the election is a blue win.
If blue districts plus lean-blue districts outnumber all districts combined, the election is a blue likely win.
If none of those four outcomes happen, the election is too close to call.

### Go (what happens each tick)

We pick one contested edge at random (ie, a link that connects two blocks in different districts). Then, one block is randomly chosen to match the other one.

First, we check whether this splits the old district into more than one component. If it does, we reject the swap.

Then, we check our population and compactness measures. Currently, there is only one population measure - standard deviation. We want the districts to have equal population, so lower is better. There are two compactness measures you can choose between using the chooser on the Interface tab - perimeter-area ratio and mean path length. Perimeter-area ratio is a measure of how much "outside" a district has - since this is often evidence of trying to include faraway districts while excluding more "sensible" closer ones out of some nefarious intent, lower is better. Mean path length looks for the same phenomena: a long, artificial "tendril" to a district will increase the main path length. Note that mean path length is substantially slower than perimeter-area ratio. That's because the latter is an agential metric (each block only needs to ask it's neighbors to know whether it's on the perimeter), while the former is a factor of the whole subgraph and consequently nine expensive calls nw:mean-path-length calls are needed.

For each measure used, if the swap improves that measure, it is accepted. If the swap degrades the score, we use the following primitive score function to decide whether or not to use the swap:

Take the difference of the old measure and the new measure. Since lower is better, this will be negative for moves that degrade the measure. Multiply the difference by the following scaling factor:

* Population standard deviation: 2
* Perimeter-area ratio: 20
* Mean path length: 2

Add the corresponding leniency factor (set by sliders on the Interface tab). Use this as the mean of a normal distribution with standard deviation 1, then generate a random number with that distribution. If that number is greater than 0, accept the swap; otherwise, reject it.

Note that these functions have no empirical backing beyond my gut feel that they generate vaguely the sort of outcomes we want. It IS important that your score function allows some swaps to make the map worse, because you don't want to get stuck in a local maxima and end up barely exploring map-space. As well, since we start with perfect square subgraphs, the first swap *necessarily* creates a worse map, so the model will get stuck in an infinite loop if your make the score functions too strict. 

If a swap is rejected by even a single measure, throw it away and start over. If a swap is accepted, we update the maps, cache the new district values in each patch within the district, update our statistics and graphs, and then attempt another swap.

## How could it be expanded?

There are two main approaches you could take with this. Whichever one you take, you probably need to change my score functions to something less arbitrary. (If you're looking for them in the code, they're in the latter half of "calculate-impact-of-swap".)

### MCMC

Duke University [has published a paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.03360.pdf) about their use of MCMC to travel around the space of all maps. But they didn't share their code, so you can't try to tweak conditions and do similar analysis. If you replace my score functions with real-world-relevant ones, and make the maps more realistic, you could have a tool where you could try out similar things. I would be especially interested in trending the proportion of rejected to accepted moves over time, which is why I added a plot for it.

### Metrics as a function of the world

Right now, most people looking at this stuff are traversing the space of all maps, saving off "good maps", then finding average values of them. But is that necessary, or can you derive the average metrics by analyzing the world? (This is analogous to a state in terms of US gerrymandering). If this is ever going to be possible, it's probably going to work for this friendly, square world.
