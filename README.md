## Modeling Virginia Voting Districts

#### Luke Palmieri, Gowri Prathap

In US politics, gerrymandering is the practice of drawing the boundaries of electoral districts in a way that either (a) gives one political party an unfair advantage over its rivals (political or partisan gerrymandering), or (b) that dilutes the voting power of members of ethnic or linguistic minority groups (racial gerrymandering). We adapted an existing NetLogo model called NetDistrict (https://github.com/gerrymandr/NetDistrict) to simulate Virginiaâ€™s voting districts. We added other important information and functions such as a drop-down menu to change the number of districts, reporters that keep track of the percentage of the red and blue areas in the model, and a slider to change partisan score odds of setting up.
